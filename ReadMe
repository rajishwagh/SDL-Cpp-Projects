This is a project that is not mine. 
I used it to teach myself basics of SDL...
My own project is still not finished and is coming soon.

This project and all it's files belong to LazyFoo Productions (http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/)

I do not hold assume any credit for this...

I am a new programmer and do not know if this disclaimer is enough...

I saved it here because I wanted to change my computer...
